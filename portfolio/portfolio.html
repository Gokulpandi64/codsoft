          <li>Predictive maintance in AI</li>
          <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIn this project, I developed an AI-powered predictive maintenance system designed to optimize the reliability and efficiency of industrial machinery. The system utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze historical sensor data, identify patterns, and predict potential equipment failures before they occur.</p>
          <li>Voice assistant uisng python</li>
          <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis project involved the creation of a custom voice assistant using Python, designed to perform a variety of tasks through voice commands. The assistant is capable of understanding natural language, processing commands, and responding intelligently, making daily tasks more efficient and interactive.
          </p>
          <li>Sentiment analysis using data science</li>
          <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis project involved developing a sentiment analysis system to analyze and classify textual data into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. Leveraging data science techniques and natural language processing (NLP), the project aims to understand public opinion, customer feedback, and social media trends.</p>
          <li>Advanced calculator in full satck</li>
          <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis project involves the development of an advanced calculator application using full-stack technologies. The calculator goes beyond basic arithmetic operations, offering a wide range of mathematical functions and a user-friendly interface, making it a powerful tool for both casual and professional use.</p>
